# RECOMMENDATION SEARCH ENGINE
# =============================
# This file is the "search engine" of the library chatbot.
# Responsibilities:
#   1. Query expansion (add synonyms and related terms)
#   2. Scoring engine (semantic similarity + popularity + keywords)
#   3. Return the top N most relevant books
#
# This file does NOT handle:
#   - Embedding creation (that's agent.py's job)
#   - User interaction or formatting (that's agent.py's job)
#   - Caching (that's agent.py's job)

# 1. QUERY EXPANSION
# ============================================================================
# Dictionary of exam/topic keywords that are expanded for better semantic matching.
# When a student searches for "JEE", the engine automatically adds related terms
# so the AI can find books on Physics, Chemistry, etc.
